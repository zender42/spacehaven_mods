<H2>Wall Object Mod (sh_wallobj_mod)</H2>
<H4>Mod for Space Haven Alpha 12 (v0.12.1)</H4>

<P>This allows you to place objects directly on the tile in front of wall power nodes, wall thermal regulators, and wall lights.</P>

<P>This mod was based on the "Better Wall Objects" mod by Joomin. It has been updated for Alpha 12 v0.12.1, and to add wall light support, as I couldn't find any mods that would let me build directly in front of a wall light.</P>

<P>This requires a modloader to use - it has been tested with Tahvohck's modloader, version 0.9.1. Check the discord for a link to the current version.</P>

<P>To use, either download the <A HREF="sh_wallobj_mod.zip">ZIP file</A> and unzip into your mods folder, or download the individual files from the tree above.</P>

<B>Neither I nor this mod are associated with Bugbyte or Space Haven in any way, other than that it modifies placement options for some objects in the game.</b>
