<H2>Wall Object Mod (sh_wallobj_mod)</H2>
<H4>Mod for Space Haven Alpha 12 (v0.12.1)</H4>

<P>This allows you to place objects directly on the tile in front of wall power nodes, wall thermal regulators, and wall lights.</P>

<P>This mod was inspired by the "Better Wall Objects" mod by Joomin. It essentially does the same thing, just using code from the Alpha 12 v0.12.1 version, and with wall light support added - I couldn't find any other mods that would let me build in front of a wall light.</P>

<P>This requires a modloader to use - it has been tested with Tahvohck's modloader, version 0.9.1. Check the discord for a link to the current version.</P>

<P>To use, either download the <A HREF="https://github.com/zender42/spacehaven_mods/blob/main/sh_wallobj_mod/sh_wallobj_mod.zip?raw=true">ZIP file</A> and unzip into your mods folder, or download the individual files from the tree above.</P>

<B>Neither I nor this mod are associated with Bugbyte or Space Haven in any way, other than that it modifies placement options for some objects in the game.</b>
